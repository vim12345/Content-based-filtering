# Content-based-filtering

# Description:
**Content-based filtering** recommends items based on the features of the items and a user’s past preferences. The system computes a similarity score between the features of items and the user’s profile, which is created from items they have liked in the past.

We’ll implement a simple content-based filtering system using TF-IDF for text-based features (e.g., movie descriptions, product features).

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates movie descriptions as features

* Uses TF-IDF to convert descriptions into vectors

* Computes cosine similarity between item features

* Recommends movies similar to Movie1 based on textual features
